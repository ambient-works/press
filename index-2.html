        Ambient Works Unveils "ambient one" on Kickstarter – The All-in-One Ambient Sensing That Guides You Through Data While Providing Actionable Solutions
      </h1>
      <p><strong>London, May 2024</strong></p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one1.jpg" alt="Ambient One Device" />

      <p>
        <a href="https://ambientworks.io" target="_blank">Ambient Works</a>, a
        pioneering start-up funded by Royal College of Art and Imperial College
        graduates, is thrilled to announce the imminent launch of "ambient one,"
        a state-of-the-art air quality monitor to track and record multiple air pollutants, get immediate AI-powered insights and obtain actionable solutions. This revolutionary device will be available for pre-order soon on Kickstarter, marking a significant leap in environmental awareness within workspaces.
        Based on the fundamental principle for which the air around us is a silent yet potent catalyst for innovative thinking (as backed by countless studies by now), ambient one bridges the gap between busy professionals and a market that is fragmented and oftetimes challenging to navigate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>
          "You can’t improve what you don’t measure. With 'ambient one'
          professionals will be able to monitor and record various pollutants in the
          air they’re breathing while receiving tailored advice on how to
          minimise toxic particles in their surroundings. Understanding and
          controlling air quality in creative and non-creative environments isn’t just about
          health; it’s about nurturing creativity and boosting productivity, and
          we have witnessed this first hand”
        </i>
        - explains Giulio Ammendola, Co-Founder of Ambient Works.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one2.jpg" alt="Ambient One in Use" />

      <p>
        The device’s number one superpower lies in its unique capability to link
        air quality data with specific activities occurring in work areas.
        This feature enables users to pinpoint which materials, processes, and
        activities contribute most to pollution. By documenting such insights on
        a clear timeline, utilisers are equipped with the tools they need to
        effectively understand and reduce their environmental impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<i
          >It's very useful to be able to tag specific activities to certain
          levels of dust, as not all carry the same risk. For instance, high
          particle levels are often linked to glazing, which is definitely something you
          want to avoid" </i
        >” - states Ceramist and ambient one user Marie Tricaud.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one3.gif" alt="Ambient One Interface" />

      <p>
        Extremely accurate, the tool offers all-in-one sensing and boasts an
        extensive suite of auditing capabilities, tracing Particulate Matter,
        Carbon Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Nitrogen Oxides
        (NOx). Enhanced by cutting-edge Swiss-made sensors, it ensures
        unparalleled precision and reliability in detecting air quality
        concerns.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one4.jpg" alt="Ambient One Display" />

      <p>
        At software-level, ambient one’s user-friendly app provides real-time data and AI-driven tips that are, as said, always tailored to the specific activities and conditions of each user’s space. Not only does this information guide you through data but it also provides valuable insights into individual processes, adding significant value to ambient one’s offerings.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one5.jpg" alt="Ambient One Placement" />

      <p>
        Intelligent and adaptable, ambient one retains a compact, familiar
        book-like format, seamlessly blending ease of use with high design
        value. This innovative tool is designed to accommodate various aspects of a daily
        routine at the studio, in the office, at the lab, or even at home.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one6.jpg" alt="Ambient One in Different Positions" />

      <p>
        It can be placed vertically, horizontally, or upside down. The display
        utilises e-paper technology, which will adjust and change modes
        automatically. It’s no news how electronic paper extends battery life
        and provides a more serene viewing experience – it won’t be just another
        screen in front of you.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one7.jpg" alt="Ambient One on Wall" />

      <p>
        Additional standout features include its built-in magnets, allowing it
        to be easily attached anywhere. This ensures that the sensors are
        positioned close to the action, thereby enhancing both functionality and
        convenience. It won’t be just another gimmick hidden next to a wifi router.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one8.jpg" alt="Ambient One Close-up" />

      <p>
        Aesthetic and functional appeal blend in an unmatched way, thanks to an
        expert choice of materials that enhances both. The main enclosure is, in
        fact, crafted from extruded aluminium profiles: sturdy and durable, it
        ensures longevity while providing a unique and premium tactile
        experience that sets ambient one apart from typical smart devices.
      </p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one9.jpg" alt="Ambient One Internals" />

      <p>
        All ambient one’s electronic components are conveniently housed within
        the aluminium extrusion and can be effortlessly removed by taking out a
        few screws. This secures straightforward access for opening, upgrading,
        and repairing. Aluminium is also highly recyclable and offers versatile
        treatment options, aligning with Ambient Works’ commitment, at the
        intersection of technology, innovation, and design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last but not least, the team is shaping the future of ambient one with
        pioneering approach, focusing on its expandability. They’re working to
        develop a modular design that would set a new standard in environmental
        health technology. This design promises unprecedented adaptability in
        environmental monitoring – so stay tuned.
