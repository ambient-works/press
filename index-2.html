        Ambient Works Unveils "ambient one" on Kickstarter – The Durable and Recyclable Air Quality Tracker Marking a Leap in Environmental Awareness within Workspaces
      </h1>
      <p><strong>London, May 2024</strong></p>

      <img src="./img/ambient-one1.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        <a href="https://ambientworks.io" target="_blank">Ambient Works</a>, a
        trailblazing start-up funded by Royal College of Art and Imperial College
        graduates, is thrilled to announce the imminent launch of "ambient one," 
        a state-of-the-art air quality monitor to track and record multiple air pollutants, 
        get immediate AI-powered insights and obtain actionable solutions. This revolutionary 
        device, soon available for pre-order on Kickstarter, marks a significant leap in 
        environmental awareness within workspaces. Formed against a backdrop of global 
        concern over indoor air quality, Ambient Works is dedicated to empowering creative 
        professionals by deepening their understanding of their own workspace environments 
        and how these can be improved for health and creativity. Their pilot creation, 
        ambient one, is their first step in this direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the fundamental principle for which the air around us is a silent yet potent catalyst 
        for innovative thinking (as backed by countless studies by now), the device bridges the gap between 
        busy professionals and a market that is fragmented and oftentimes challenging to navigate. 
        <i>"You can’t improve what you don’t measure. With 'ambient one' professionals will be able to monitor 
        and record various pollutants in the air they’re breathing while receiving tailored advice on how to 
        minimise toxic particles in their surroundings. Understanding and controlling air quality in creative 
        and non-creative environments isn’t just about health; it’s about nurturing creativity and boosting 
        productivity, and we have witnessed this first hand”</i> – explains Giulio Ammendola, Co-Founder of Ambient Works.

      <p>
        Ambient one uniquely correlates air quality data with specific workplace activities, allowing users to identify 
        which materials and practices contribute most to pollution. This capability, coupled with a comprehensive auditing 
        system capable of detecting Particulate Matter, Carbon Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Nitrogen Oxides 
        (NOx), makes it an essential tool for environmentally conscious professionals. The device is equipped with high-precision 
        Swiss-made sensors, ensuring extremely accurate and reliable air quality assessments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The accompanying user-friendly App provides real-time data and AI-driven tips, tailored to the specific conditions of each 
        user’s space. This not only helps in navigating through the data but also sheds light on individual processes, significantly 
        enhancing the value offered by ambient one.

      <p>
        Intelligent and adaptable, ambient one retains a compact, familiar book-like format, seamlessly blending ease of use with high 
        design value. This innovative tool is designed to accommodate various aspects of a daily routine at the studio, in the office, 
        at the lab, or even at home. Its e-paper display technology optimises battery life and ensures a comfortable viewing experience, 
        distinguishing it from other digital screens.

      <p>
        Additional features include built-in magnets for easy attachment near active areas, and ease of access for opening, upgrading, 
        and repairing the device. This thoughtful design, enhancing both functionality and convenience, is combined with an expert choice 
        of material. Its main enclosure is, in fact, crafted from extruded aluminium profiles: sturdy and durable, aluminium is also highly 
        recyclable and offers versatile treatment options. Durable, recyclable and reparable ambient one underscores Ambient Works’ dedication 
        to merging technology with sustainable design practices.

      <p>
        Last but not least, the team is shaping the future of ambient one with pioneering approach, focusing on its expandability. They’re 
        working to develop a modular design that would set a new standard in environmental health technology. This design promises unprecedented 
        adaptability in environmental monitoring – so stay tuned.
