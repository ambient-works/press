        and Recyclable Air Quality Tracker Marking a Leap in Environmental
        Awareness within Workspaces
      </h1>

      <p>
        <a href="https://ambientworks.io" target="_blank">Ambient Works</a>, a
        trailblazing start-up funded by Royal College of Art and Imperial
        College graduates, is thrilled to announce the imminent launch of
        "ambient one," a state-of-the-art air quality monitor to track and
        record multiple air pollutants, get immediate AI-powered insights and
        obtain actionable solutions. This revolutionary device, soon available
        for pre-order on Kickstarter, marks a significant leap in environmental
        awareness within workspaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Formed against a backdrop of global concern over indoor air quality,
        Ambient Works is dedicated to empowering creative professionals by
        deepening their understanding of their own workspace environments and
        how these can be improved for health and creativity. Their pilot
        creation, ambient one, is their first step in this direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the fundamental principle for which the air around us is a
        silent yet potent catalyst for innovative thinking (as backed by
        countless studies by now), the device bridges the gap between busy
        professionals and a market that is fragmented and oftetimes challenging
        to navigate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>
          "You can’t improve what you don’t measure. With 'ambient one'
          creatives will be able to monitor and record various pollutants in the
          air they’re breathing while receiving tailored advice on how to
          minimise toxic particles in their surroundings. Understanding and
          controlling air quality in creative environments isn’t just about
          health; it’s about nurturing creativity and boosting productivity, and
          we have witnessed this first hand”
        </i>
        — explains Giulio Ammendola, Co-Founder of Ambient Works.

      <p>
        Ambient one uniquely correlates air quality data with specific workplace
        activities, allowing users to identify which materials and practices
        contribute most to pollution. This capability, coupled with a
        comprehensive auditing system capable of detecting Particulate Matter,
        Carbon Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Nitrogen Oxides
        (NOx), makes it an essential tool for environmentally conscious
        professionals. The device is equipped with high-precision Swiss-made
        sensors, ensuring extremely accurate and reliable air quality
        assessments.

        The accompanying user-friendly App provides real-time data and AI-driven
        tips, tailored to the specific conditions of each user’s space. This not
        only helps in navigating through the data but also sheds light on
        individual processes, significantly enhancing the value offered by
        ambient one.

      <p>
        Intelligent and adaptable, ambient one retains a compact, familiar
        book-like format, seamlessly blending ease of use with high design
        value. This innovative tool is designed to accommodate various aspects
        of a daily routine at the studio, in the office, at the lab, or even at
        home. Its e-paper display technology optimises battery life and ensures
        a comfortable viewing experience, distinguishing it from other digital
        screens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additional features include built-in magnets for easy attachment near
        active areas, and ease of access for opening, upgrading, and repairing
        the device. This thoughtful design, enhancing both functionality and
        convenience, is combined with an expert choice of material. Its main
        enclosure is, in fact, crafted from extruded aluminium profiles: sturdy
        and durable, aluminium is also highly recyclable and offers versatile
        treatment options. Durable, recyclable and reparable ambient one
        underscores Ambient Works’ dedication to merging technology with
        sustainable design practices.

        Last but not least, the team is shaping the future of ambient one with
        pioneering approach, focusing on its expandability. They’re working to
        develop a modular design that would set a new standard in environmental
        health technology. This design promises unprecedented adaptability in
        environmental monitoring – so stay tuned.
