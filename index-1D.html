      <h1>
        Ambient Works Unveils <i>ambient one</i> on Kickstarter – The First Air
        Quality Tracker Made by Creators, for Creators
      </h1>
      <p><strong>London, June 2024</strong></p>

      <img src="./images/ambient_works_6.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        <a href="https://ambientworks.io" target="_blank">Ambient Works</a>, a
        pioneering start-up funded by Royal College of Art and Imperial College
        graduates, is thrilled to announce the imminent launch of "ambient one,"
        a state-of-the-art air quality monitor designed specifically for makers
        and creators. This revolutionary device will be available for pre-order
        soon on Kickstarter, marking a significant leap in environmental
        awareness within creative spaces. Rooted in the fundamental principle
        for which the air around us is a silent yet potent catalyst for creative
        thinking (as backed by countless studies by now), ambient one bridges
        the gap between busy makers and a market that is fragmented and
        oftentimes challenging to navigate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>
          "You can’t improve what you don’t measure. With 'ambient one'
          creatives will be able to monitor and record various pollutants in the
          air they’re breathing while receiving tailored advice on how to
          minimise toxic particles in their surroundings. Understanding and
          controlling air quality in creative environments isn’t just about
          health; it’s about nurturing creativity and boosting productivity, and
          we have witnessed this first hand”
        </i>
        — explains Giulio Ammendola, Co-Founder of Ambient Works.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/ambient_works_12.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        The device’s number one superpower lies in its unique capability to link
        air quality data with specific activities occurring in creative spaces.
        This feature enables users to pinpoint which materials, processes, and
        activities contribute most to pollution. By documenting such insights on
        a clear timeline, makers are equipped with the tools they need to
        effectively understand and reduce their environmental impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<i
          >It's very useful to be able to tag specific activities to certain
          levels of dust, as not all carry the same risk. For instance, high
          particulate matter levels while glazing is definitely something you
          want to avoid, as glazes can contain harmful levels of silica" </i
        > — states Ceramist and Designer, Marie Tricaud (ambient one beta
        tester).

        Intelligent and versatile, ambient one retains a compact, familiar
        book-like format, seamlessly blending ease of use with high design
        value. Created by makers for makers, this innovative tool is designed to
        accommodate various aspects of a creative’s routine in the studio, at
        the lab, or even at home.
      </p>

        It can be placed vertically, horizontally, or upside down. The display
        utilises e-paper technology, which will adjust and change modes
        automatically. It’s no news how electronic paper extends battery life
        and provides a more serene viewing experience – it won’t be just another
        screen in front of you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additional standout features include its built-in magnets, allowing it
        to be easily attached anywhere. This ensures that the sensors are
        positioned close to the action, thereby enhancing both functionality and
        convenience. It won’t be another gimmick hidden next to a wifi router.

        Visual and functional appeal blend in an unmatched way, thanks to an
        expert choice of materials that enhances both. The main enclosure is, in
        fact, crafted from extruded aluminium profiles: sturdy and durable, it
        ensures longevity while providing a unique and premium tactile
        experience that sets ambient one apart from typical smart devices.
      </p>

      <img src="./image/ambient_works_11.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        All ambient one’s electronic components are conveniently housed within
        the aluminium extrusion and can be effortlessly removed by taking out a
        few screws. This secures straightforward access for opening, upgrading,
        and repairing. Aluminium is also highly recyclable and offers versatile
        treatment options, aligning with Ambient Works’ commitment, at the
        intersection of fine design, innovation, and technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fun and adaptable, but not compromising in accuracy – the tool boasts an
        extensive suite of auditing capabilities, tracing Particulate Matter,
        Carbon Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Nitrogen Oxides
        (NOx). Equipped with cutting-edge Swiss-made sensors, it ensures
        unparalleled precision and reliability in detecting air quality
        concerns.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/ambient_works_20.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        Not to be overlooked, ambient one’s user-friendly app provides real-time
        data and AI-driven tips that, as mentioned, are always tailored to the
        specific activities and conditions of each user’s space. This
        information, in turn, provides valuable insights into individual
        creative processes, adding significant value to ambient one’s offerings.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/ambient_works_18.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        Last but not least, the team is shaping the future of ambient one with
        pioneering approach, focusing on its expandability. They’re working to
        develop a modular design that would not only promise unprecedented
        adaptability but would also elevate its aesthetic and functional
        capabilities — so stay tuned.
